<p class="grey-text">Documentation to help setup a client to use this adverts solution</p>
<p>This solution uses a JSON file hosted on S3 that is downloaded by each client and parsed in order to decide if and how to show the adverts for their client</p>
<hr>
<p>To start, make a request to <code>GET https://s3.amazonaws.com/opsview-adverts/adverts.json</code> to get the JSON config data</p>
<p>Next parse that data as an object or hash; the embed below will show you what the structure of the JSON is</p>

<p>The following pseudo code should be used to determine if and how to show adverts:</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    IF advertDb.advertsStatus == true AND advertDb.adverts.length != 0
    THEN
      // This is line client specific
      currentAdName = 'currentAdvertMobile' || 'currentAdvertDesktop1' || 'currentAdvertDesktop2'

      curentAd = advertDb.adverts FIND WHERE advert.name == currentAdName

      // Check that there is an ad available to show to the user
      IF currentAd == undefined
      THEN
        IF advertDB.adverts[0]
        THEN
          currentAd = advertDB.adverts[0]
        ELSE
          exit

      // Check the target version of the ad matches the version that the client is using
      IF currentAd.targetVersion.indexOf('all') == -1
      THEN
        IF currentAd.targetVersion.indexOf(CLIENT_OPSVIEW_VERSION) == -1
        THEN
          exit

      showAdvert(currentAd.s3Url, currentAd.redirectUrl)
    ELSE
      exit
  </code>
</pre>
